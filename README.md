# Wordle Clone
    An imitation of the upcoming trendy browser game Wordle written in Python! 
    
### How does it work?
    - It utilizes built-in data structures and string manipulation to mimic the display of right/wrong guesses.
    - For words, it randomly grabs from an external file (which is included) and randomizes the word every game.
    
### How many times can I play?
    - You can play as many times as you want!
    - Each game allows you to have 5 guesses just like the real version.
    - If you guess the word, it displays the guesses it took (with the use of a counter variable).
    - If you don't guess it within 5 tries, you will be shown the word and a prompt to play again.
    
### Why create such a clone in the first place?
    - It seemed like a fun project that I could take on with my existing Python skills!
    - There are many clones out there, but I mostly wanted to see if I could apply what I've learned to create new things.
